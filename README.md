---

## 4) System Architecture

1. Spring Boot application (multi-layered, DI)
2. PostgreSQL for persistence (Users, Holdings, Transactions, Watchlists, etc.)
3. Market data aggregation via external APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Finnhub)
4. WebSocket/STOMP endpoint (/ws/trades) for live trade updates
5. AI Insights endpoint backed by Gemini
6. Planned:

---

## 5) Database Schema

The application uses a normalized PostgreSQL schema to manage user, portfolio, watchlist, and transaction data.

---

## 6) Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 (JDK)
- Git
- PostgreSQL (local or via Docker)
- Optional (planned): Docker & Docker Compose (for Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis stack)

### 1) Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soumyadip-gole/Quantify.git
cd Quantify
```

### 2) Configure Environment
This project uses an application.properties file for configuration. Since it contains sensitive information, it is ignored by Git.

1. Create `src/main/resources/application.properties`
2. Copy the contents from `application-example.properties` (if present)
3. Replace placeholders with your actual credentials and API keys

See Configuration Reference below for keys and example values.

### 3) Run the Application (Maven)
You can run the application from your IDE or via Maven:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- Local URL: http://localhost:8080
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

### Optional: 4) Run Dependencies with Docker Compose (planned)
A docker-compose.yml is planned to simplify local setup for PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis. Example (to be added to the repo):

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    container_name: quantify-postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: quantify
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    container_name: quantify-rabbitmq
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672" # management UI

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    container_name: quantify-redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  pg_data:
```

You would then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## 7) Configuration Reference

Create `src/main/resources/application.properties` with values similar to:

```properties
# --- Database ---
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/quantify
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD_HERE
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# --- Swagger/OpenAPI (if applicable) ---
springdoc.api-docs.enabled=true
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true

# --- Security: OAuth2 (Google) ---
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.scope=openid,profile,email
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.redirect-uri={baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/google

# --- External APIs ---
alpha.vantage.api.key=YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY
finnhub.api.key=YOUR_FINNHUB_KEY
# If used: yahoo.finance.api.key=YOUR_YAHOO_KEY

# --- AI (Gemini) ---
gemini.api.key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY

# --- WebSocket (typical Spring defaults; adjust if customized) ---
spring.websocket.path=/ws/trades

# --- Caching (planned) ---
# spring.cache.type=redis
# spring.data.redis.host=localhost
# spring.data.redis.port=6379

# --- Messaging (planned) ---
# spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
# spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
# spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
# spring.rabbitmq.password=guest

# --- Logging ---
# Use SLF4J + Logback configuration as needed
```

Notes:
- Current auth is session-based for email/password. JWT support is under evaluation (see Roadmap).
- You must supply your own API keys for Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, and Gemini.

---

## 8) Real-Time WebSocket Feed

Quantify exposes a WebSocket endpoint that bridges to Finnhubâ€™s real-time trade stream.

- Endpoint: `/ws/trades` (STOMP)
- Connect using a STOMP WebSocket client from the browser or server
- Subscribe to the destination(s) exposed by the backend (see code/config); the server relays live trade messages

Example (JavaScript, using @stomp/stompjs):
```js
import { Client } from '@stomp/stompjs';

const client = new Client({
  brokerURL: 'ws://localhost:8080/ws/trades', // use wss:// for production SSL
  reconnectDelay: 5000,
});

client.onConnect = () => {
  // Replace with your actual destination (e.g., '/topic/trades')
  client.subscribe('/topic/trades', message => {
    console.log('Trade update:', JSON.parse(message.body));
  });
};

client.activate();
```

For endpoint specifics (destinations, payload shape), refer to the code and Swagger (where applicable).

## 9) Roadmap & Project Status

Backend foundation is solid and deployed. The following tasks track remaining work:

### Phase 1: Frontend & Core Trading
- [ ] Frontend (React): Login/Registration, Dashboard, Portfolio, Trading panels, Watchlists
- [ ] WebSocket integration in UI for real-time prices
- [ ] Async Trading Engine
  - [ ] Define TradeMessage DTO
  - [ ] POST `/api/trade/buy` and `/api/trade/sell`
  - [ ] RabbitMQ: queues, exchanges, bindings
  - [ ] Producer (publish trade messages)
  - [ ] Consumer (update balance/holdings, create transaction records)
- [ ] Redis Caching
  - [ ] Add `@EnableCaching` and `CacheConfig`
  - [ ] Apply `@Cacheable` to high-traffic reads (e.g., quotes)

### Phase 2: Refinements & DevOps
- [ ] Refactor Backend
  - [ ] Controllers: prefer `@RequestParam`/path variables over `@RequestBody` for GET
  - [ ] Security: derive user from `SecurityContext` (no client-supplied IDs)
  - [ ] Logging: replace `System.out.println` with SLF4J and proper levels
  - [ ] Naming: rename lower-case model/controller classes to PascalCase
- [ ] Standardize Authentication
  - [ ] Decide: tighten CSRF with sessions vs. adopt JWT
  - [ ] If JWT: issue on login + Bearer filter for protected routes
- [ ] Containerization
  - [ ] Dockerfile for Spring Boot
  - [ ] docker-compose for Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis
- [ ] CI/CD
  - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow to build/test on push

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & AI
- [ ] Backtesting Engine
- [ ] Monitoring/Observability (metrics, tracing, dashboards)
- [ ] Future: Python microservice for stock ratings and news sentiment analysis
